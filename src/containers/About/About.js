 //I'm a software developer living and working in Los Angeles, California.  I work hard every day at being a better version of myself.  I'm passionate about doing my part to help make this world a better place.  What I love about coding is its powerful ability to improve lives and communities for the better.  I'm interested in building apps that have positive impacts on society and the environment; improves the quality of daily life, improves work flow, reduces the carbon footprint.  I don't give a shit about another messaging app with cute emojis.  What I care about is depth, meaning and connection with other people.
 // You will usually find me with my sleeves rolled up, ready to put the work in to accomplish the task at hand. I am intellectually curious about things related to programming, science, math, literature and life in general. My personal and professional interests are about exploring the intersections of the arts, humanities and technology.
   // When I'm not coding, I try to keep up with current events and technological trends as well as enjoying a wide range of hobbies, interests and exploring the outdoors.
   // A few quotes that get me out of bed early: "Endure the pain of discipline or suffer the pain of regret"...“The place to improve the world is first in one's own heart and head and hands, and then work outward from there”..."Work hard! Being tired is better than being disappointed"
   // I hold dual citizenships and two passports in the European Union and United States. I am open to relocation.  Thanks for reading:)
